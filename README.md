# PrimeNumbers
A python class to generate prime numbers and factorize integers.

---------

Hi, Github users :)

I'm an Italian student and I'm really interested in mastering Python. I believe
that most of the software should be free and open source, in order to allow 
people to collaborate and build together a better future.

This piece of software is a python class designed to create a generator of prime
numbers and to factorize integers. I am sharing it under no license: you can use
it wherever you want. Please, forgive me for my bad English and, if you have any
suggestion on how to make this algorithm better, you are welcome to share
them with me and the community. 

Thanks.
